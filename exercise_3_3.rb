# Mixing in modules
#[6] Create a method that returns today's date. Method name should be 'current_date'
# This method should be in a module called 'Generic'.
# Try mixing in this module into the Document class
# Now use this method to create another method that returns
# The tite of the document and today's date like below:
# "document_title 2014-06-22". This method should be called 'title_with_date'


#[7] we would like to add a function that replaces a word with another
# replace_word(old_word, new_word)

#Metaprogramming
#[8] instead of calling document.replace_word(old,new) we would like to be able to
# do something like this: document.replace_book('pen') where book is the old word
# and pen is the new word. This should work on any word (not just book).
# hint:  'method_missing'

require 'time'
